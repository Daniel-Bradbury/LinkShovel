# LinkShovel
When given a URL (e.g. https://google.com), LinkShovel will scrape every URL linked to on that site, and will put it into links.txt. It will then randomly pick a link from links.txt and will search that URL for links, which it will then add to links.txt, and this will repeat until the program turned off
