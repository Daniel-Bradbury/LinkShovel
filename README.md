# LinkShovel
A simple webcrawler that will scrape every URL linked to on a given site, and will put it into a `links.txt` file. It will then randomly pick a link from links.txt and will search that page for links, and will then add _those_ to links.txt. This will be repeated indefinitely until the program is turned off
